Please Note: I have missed several Changelog entries. Sorry for that most
source files are poorly documented (but understandable).


Note: DON'T ever use the source code of this project to learn LaTeX.  These
were written, while I just headed into LaTeX, probably during 2011-2012.  The files
have several ugly hacks, which should better, not be used.
